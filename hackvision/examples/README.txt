==================================================

This includes libraries and examples for the Video Game Shield.  The Video Game Shield is an expansion board for the Arduino microcontroller board.  It provides circuitry to enable analog black and white TV output as well as use two Wii Nunchucks.

This software is the other half of the project.  This software helps make it easy to make your own programs that use the features of the Video Game Shield.

Some of the libraries are MIT licensed, while some are GPL licensed.

Installing
==========
To install, extract the folders in this zip archive into your sketchbook, in a "libraries" subdirectory. On Windows, your sketchbook is probably in your My Documents, named "Arduino". On Linux, your sketchbook is probably ~/sketchbook/.

If you're using a Mac, OSX probably unzipped the zip file with its own top-level directory. This is incorrect behavior, since our zip file doesn't have a top-level directory inside. To work around this issue, you should copy all the files and folders from this errant top-level folder into your sketchbook's libraries folder.

More verbosely, straight from the horse's mouth (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries):

> If you're using one of these libraries, you need to install it first. To do 
> so, download the library and unzip it. It should be in a folder of its own,
> and will typically contain at least two files, one with a .h suffix and 
> one with a .cpp suffix. Open your Arduino sketchbook folder. If there is 
> already a folder there called libraries, place the library folder in there.
>
> If not, create a folder called libraries in the sketchbook folder, and drop
> the library folder in there. Then re-start the Arduino programming 
> environment, and you should see your new library in the 
> Sketch > Import Library menu.
